# Luctusproxy

This is a simple UDP proxy.  
It was written for and works well with games like Garry's Mod (Source Engine, entirely UDP based gameservers).

It is a good example of showing how to send and receive UDP packets, how to use and parse flags and how to make a program wait until it is killed.
